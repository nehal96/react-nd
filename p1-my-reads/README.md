# Project 1: A Book Tracking App

The project is maintained over at the [book-tracking-app repo](https://github.com/nehal96/book-tracking-app). It's also kept here because it's part of the React Nanodegree.

### Project Overview

Listopia is a simple book-tracking application that allows you to add and move your books across three shelves: **Currently Reading**, **Want to Read**, and **Read**. The project is built using React, and is meant to be a way of implementing React Fundamentals, including Components, props, state management, JSX notation, and routing, among others.
